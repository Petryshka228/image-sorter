# image-sorter
This program performs the functions of sorting images and renaming them.

The " imagehash " library is used to determine the uniqueness of images.
The library "imagehash" was borrowed from here https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash .
The program also works with the os, so it is important to specify the path to the directories to work with.
